## üîß Production Integration

### Switching from Mock to Production APIs

The application is designed for seamless transition from mock to production services:

1. **Set environment variable**
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=https://your-production-api.com/api
   ```

2. **Update service adapters**
   Each service adapter in `services/` has TODO comments indicating where to integrate production endpoints:

   ```typescript
   // services/predictionAdapter.ts
   export const getPredictionsForTrains = async (trains: Train[]): Promise<Prediction[]> => {
     // TODO: Replace with actual ML prediction endpoint
     // const predictions = await mlPredictionService.getPredictions({
     //   trainIds: trains.map(t => t.id),
     //   currentTime: new Date().toISOString(),
     //   modelVersion: 'v2.1.3'
     // });
     
     const response = await apiPost<ApiResponse<Prediction[]>>('/predictions', {
       trainIds: trains.map(train => train.id),
       timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
     });
     
     return response.data;
   };
   ```

### Required Production Services

To fully integrate with production ML systems, implement these endpoints:

#### ML Prediction Service

- **Output**: Delay forecasts with confidence scores

#### Optimization Service (GA/NSGA-II)
- **Endpoint**: `/recommendations`  
- **Purpose**: Multi-objective optimization for network efficiency
- **Input**: System state, objectives, constraints
- **Output**: Pareto-optimal recommendations with alternatives

#### Simulation Engine
- **Endpoint**: `/simulate`
- **Purpose**: Discrete event simulation for what-if analysis
- **Input**: Scenario parameters, network model, time horizon
- **Output**: Projected impacts with timeline data

#### Audit Database
- **Purpose**: Immutable audit trail with cryptographic integrity
- **Features**: Hash chains, digital signatures, compliance reporting
- **Storage**: Append-only with retention policies

## üìö API Documentation

### Request/Response Format
All APIs follow consistent patterns:

**Successful Response:**
```json
{
  "data": { /* response payload */ },
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "metadata": {
    "total": 10,
    "page": 1,
    "processingTime": "0.3s"
  }
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,

  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "details": { /* additional error context */ }
}
```

### Authentication (Production)
When implementing authentication, use these patterns:

```typescript
// Add to API routes
const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
if (!session) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
}
```
